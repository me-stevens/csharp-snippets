# C&#35; snippets

A collection of very basic C&#35; snippets, from simple console applications to Windows Forms and a bit of WPF too. The code is explained in the dedicated site: http://csharpsnippets.tk

You need to have Visual Studio installed to run the projects (version 2012 or superior). You can download it for free [here](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/visual-studio-homepage-vs.aspx).

Double click on the "solution" file (`*.sln`) to open the snippets in VS, then hit the green **Play** button to run them.
